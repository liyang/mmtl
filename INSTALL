TNT Installation Instructions
------------------------------


TNT is free software.  These instructions should help you configure,
build, and install TNT from the source code.


Compiling and Installing TNT
----------------------------

To compile TNT, you will need the following on your machine:

  C, C++, and FORTRAN compilers
  pdflatex and latex2html for documentation

To compile and install TNT, type the following

  ./configure --prefix=/location/to/install/tnt
  make
  make install

The configure script will analyze your system and generate makefiles
with the proper flags and macros.  You really should use the
--prefix=xxx option to control the installation location.  Installing
to the default locations (/usr/bin, /usr/lib, etc.) will spread the
application files all over your system, and it will install README and
the license file into /usr.  Configure's --help option will list other
options and explain defaults.

To choose a new compiler, you can set environment variables or
set flags on the configure command line.  The autotools will 
generally try to use the GNU compilers (gcc, g++, g77), but you
could select a native compilers like this.

  ./configure CC=c89 CXX=CC F77=f90

Builds have been tested on Red Hat Fedora Core 2 Linux, HP-UX 11,
and Microsoft Windows under Cygwin, but the code should compile on
other Unix-like systems as well.  



Running TNT
-----------

Running TNT requires a functioning installation of Tcl with Tk,
BWidget, Incr Tcl, and IWidgets extensions.  These are available in
source code form from http://tcl.sourceforge.net/,
http://tcllib.sourceforge.net/, and http://incrtcl.sourceforge.net/.
You may also get a pre-compiled package called ActiveTcl from
http://activestate.com/tcl/

To run TNT, make sure that the TNT package /bin directory and the wish
interpreter are both in your PATH.  Run tnt from the command line or
from a shortcut.  See the user guide for details on TNT operation.


Installing on Microsoft Windows
-------------------------------

TNT has been compiled and installed on Microsoft Windows computers
using the Cygwin development package from
http://sources.redhat.com/cygwin/.  The same configure/make/make
install process described for Unix systems should work from the Cygwin
command window.

If you get the Windows binary installation of TNT, then compiling and
installing from the command line will not be necessary.  Just follow
the usual installation procedures for Windows applications.
