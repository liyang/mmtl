	units package installation instructions


This tcl library provides the 'units' package for use within 
applications.

The library includes GNU autotools files for configuring and
installing the library.  It can either be installed on its own, or it
can be installed as a subdirectory of sppdgTcllib.  These instructions
are for individual installation.

Before installing, make sure that the package version numbers match in
all the right places.  The version number in units.tcl and
pkgIndex.tcl (on the [package provide] and [package ifneeded] lines)
control the version number within the Tcl interpreter.  The version
numbers in configure.ac control the directory numbering for the target
installation.  All files should also be tagged in CVS with the proper
version number, where the tag is of the form units_1_3_2 (using
underscores instead of periods).

To make and install this library, select a prefix for installation,
usually matching sppdgTcllib's location.


NOTE: This will install units in .../sppdgTcllib0.1/lib -- for now, just
      move the directory up one level. (skz)
