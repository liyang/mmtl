After much struggling, waiting, deciding, waiting some more, and
eventually approving, TNT and MMTL are being released under the GNU
General Public License.  For the first time, these relatively
straight-foward signal integrity tools are available to the public at
large.  See http://mmtl.sourceforge.net/ for the distribution.
