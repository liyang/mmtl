	sppdgTcllib package installation instructions


This library is a collection of pure-tcl packages.  The library itself
is really just a container for the other packages.  The only function
of the pkgIndex.tcl file located here is to extend the auto_path to
pick up subdirectories of this package.  This is similar to the tcllib
package.

But the installation is a little tricky.  Since we're using autoconf
and automake to generate the configuration and make files, the
subdirectories of this package would normally get installed directly
into $(prefix)/lib.  But we want them to get installed into a
subdirectory of this library.  So we play a trick in Makefile.am to
redefine $(libdir).

The bottom line is that this directory and its subdirectories get
installed into $(prefix)/lib.  This should be fine for any application
that includes sppdgTcllib as a component.  But it doesn't support the
SPPDG standard for portable script libraries, which is to put them
into //sppdgfs/lib/common.  For that, you must install the library,
then manually move it to the proper place.

  ./configure --prefix=//sppdgfs/software/lib/common
  make
  make install
  mv //sppdgfs/software/lib/common/lib/sppdgTcllib* \
     //sppdgfs/software/lib/common
  rmdir //sppdgfs/software/lib/common/lib
